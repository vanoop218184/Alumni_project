            In the late fifties, the Government of India decided to establish
            Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) under the Quality Technical
            Education Policy – one each in every major state – with the prime
            objective of imparting quality technical education throughout the
            country and to foster national integration. These Regional
            Engineering Colleges were established as joint ventures of the
            Government of India and the respective State Governments. Assam is
            considered as the flag bearer of the Northeast India and so in the
            year 1967 the 15th REC was officially established in Silchar.
            However it took almost a decade for REC Silchar to start its
            academic programmes due to various constraints.<br></br><br></br> The first batch of
            students were admitted in 1977 in the BE program in 3 branches of
            engineering namely, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and
            Electrical Engineering. The total intake in the first batch was 60
            students. The inadequate infrastructure facilities consisted of only
            a part of a hostel, two Assam type buildings (for classes and
            administration), a workshop building, seven faculty quarters and a
            few staff quarters when the College started its academic programme
            in November 1977. Initially under the guidance of the then Principal
            Dr. H. R. Chablani, the classes started with only four full time
            Faculty members. The College started its academic programme with
            affiliation from Gauhati University. The first batch of BE students
            were awarded degrees in the year 1982-83. Subsequently, two more
            branches, namely, Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, and
            Computer Science and Engineering started functioning from the year
            1983 and 1987, respectively. The affiliation was later shifted to
            Assam University in 1994.<br></br><br></br> On the basis of the report of the High
            Powered Joint Expert Committee of AICTE and UGC under the
            chairmanship of Prof. S. K. Joshi, Director General of Council for
            Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Regional Engineering
            College Silchar has been transformed and upgraded to National
            Institute of Technology, Silchar with the status of Deemed
            University on 28th June 2002. The institute has been taken over by
            Government of India and subsequently made into a fully funded
            Central Government Autonomous Institution. This ensures a better
            financial status for NIT Silchar and will accelerate its growth
            ensuring that it becomes one of the premier technological institutes
            of not just the North- East but the entire nation. The institute has
            remodeled its curriculum and academic activities in line with that
            of the IITs. With its Deemed University status, the institute
            started awarding degrees from the year 2002 and the first
            convocation of the institute was held on 16 February 2004. The
            Government of India declared the Institute as an Institute of
            National Importance by enacting the National Institutes of
            Technology Act 2007.
